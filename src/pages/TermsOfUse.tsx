      This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you, either as an individual or on
      behalf of an entity (“you”), and Elvyn (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Agreement governs your access to and use of
      the elvyn.ai website along with any associated media forms, channels, mobile website, or linked web applications
      (collectively referred to as the “Site”).

      <br/>

      By accessing the Site, you confirm that you have read, understood, and consent to be bound by all terms and
      conditions of this Agreement, which includes our Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you
      must cease using the Site immediately.

      <br/>

      We may post additional terms and conditions or documents on the Site periodically, which are explicitly
      incorporated into this Agreement by reference. We reserve the right to amend or modify these terms at our
      discretion at any time, for any reason. Changes will be communicated by updating the "last updated" date of this
      Agreement, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each change.

      <br/>

      It is your responsibility to review these terms regularly to stay informed of updates. Your continued use of the
      Site after the posting of revised terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are bound by such
      revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to review the current terms to which you are bound.

      <br/>

      The Site is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where
      such distribution or use would be contrary to local law or regulation, or which would subject us to any
      registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Those who choose to access the Site from other
      locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, to the extent
      applicable.

      <br/>

      The Site is specifically designed for professional use, and consumer protection laws may not apply to users of the
      Site. By using the Site, you acknowledge that you are engaging with the Site for professional purposes.

      <br/>

      Users must be at least 18 years old to use the Site. Access to or use of the Site by anyone under 18 is strictly
      prohibited and constitutes a violation of this Agreement.

      <br/>

      You acknowledge that you have chosen to subscribe to the Services with a full understanding of the risks
      associated with them, including the level of risk you are willing to accept. The pricing agreed upon under this
      Agreement reflects these considerations and is fundamental to the economic balance of this Agreement.

      end-users. This may include data you choose to import from third-party services, messages you send, files you
      upload, comments on files, and any other material you enter or upload into the Services.

      <br/>

      In order to use our Services, you must link a third-party LinkedIn account to your Services account. By using the

      We require the ability to transmit, store, and copy Your Data to display it to you and your teammates, index it
      for search capabilities, make backups to prevent data loss, and more. Your acceptance of these Terms of Service
      grants us the necessary rights to perform these actions solely to provide the service and for no other purpose.
      This permission extends to using third-party service providers (such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, OpenAI)
      in the operation and administration of the service. The rights granted to us are also extended to these third
      parties to the extent necessary for the provision of the service.

      You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of Your Data, and your communications with others while
      using the Services. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all the necessary rights and permissions to
      comply with these Terms and to avoid infringement or violation of any rights of others. You will be responsible
      for ensuring your users' compliance with these Terms, using commercially reasonable efforts to prevent
      unauthorized access to or use of the Services, and notifying us promptly of any such unauthorized access or use.
      We are not obliged to monitor any information on the Services, nor are we responsible for the accuracy,
      completeness, appropriateness, safety, or legality of Your Data or any other information or content you may access
      using the Services.

      <br/>

      We process personal data on your behalf as a processor within the meaning of the GDPR. These terms and conditions
      incorporate the Data Processing Agreement (DPA). By signing these terms and conditions, you accept the DPA.

      <br/>

      Additionally, in the event of support assistance with your problems, it may become necessary for us to access your
      records. This access can be conducted via a web meeting with you or through database analysis. You grant us the
      right to access your data for such purposes and agree to comply with the necessary protocols during such
      processes.

      <br/>

      <div className="text-heading-4">Content Responsibility</div>


      As a user of Elvyn, you are solely and completely responsible for any data, information, or content you distribute
      through the Service, including comments, posts, reposts, messages, or any content generated by third-party
      services such as OpenAI (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Content"). You hold full responsibility for the
      compliance of such Content with all applicable regulations and laws.

      <br/>

      The Service includes features that generate drafts of comments and suggested actions. Although these suggestions
      are auto-generated, you explicitly agree to thoroughly review, approve, or correct them as necessary before use.
      You take full responsibility for this Content and for all consequences that may arise from its use, including
      legal, reputational, or other impacts.

      <br/>

      You acknowledge and warrant that the Content, whether in whole or in part, shall not:

      <br/>

      Infringe, misappropriate, or violate any rights, particularly intellectual property rights, of any third party;
      Contain viruses or programs designed to damage, intercept, or misappropriate any system, data, or personal data in
      a fraudulent manner;
      Include unlawful, bullying, harassing, libelous, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise
      objectionable material, or any material that encourages behavior that could constitute a criminal offense, lead to
      civil liability, or otherwise violate any law;
      Contain sensitive personal data, such as social security numbers, individually identifiable health or health
      insurance information, bank account details, or credit card numbers;
      Be false, misleading, or inaccurate;
      Violate our Operating Policies.

      <br/>

      You recognize that we have the right, though not the obligation, to monitor the Service and any Data submitted to
      it. To comply with legal obligations, we may take any action we reasonably deem necessary to prevent unlawful
      activity in connection with the Service.

      <br/>

      You expressly acknowledge and agree that Elvyn shall not be liable for any loss or destruction of Content,
      including Data, and that you are responsible for maintaining appropriate backups of all Content.

      <br/>

      Furthermore, you agree to reimburse us for any action or formality we may be required to undertake to comply with
      a legal demand or request from an administrative or judicial authority in relation to your use of the Service.
      In the event you become aware of any violation of these Terms or applicable laws and regulations by any third

      under these Terms until the event ends. If the Force Majeure event continues for more than sixty (60) days, either
      party may terminate the Agreement by giving notice, effective immediately.
